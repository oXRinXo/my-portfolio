<p>Still cannot decide with I like most, so I just put them here as a trilogy. <br>

<h3>Ghost in the Shell</h3>
<p>The anime version. Love the art and storytelling and I really think it's so cool how it inspired the Matrix movies.</p>

<h2>And here's my favourite shows</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood</h3>
<p>One of the best animes I ever watched.</p>

<p>Season 1 made me fall in love with anime when I was a kid.</p>
